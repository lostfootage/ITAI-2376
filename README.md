# ITAI-2376

Welcome to my Deep Learning course portfolio! This repository contains my notes, reflections, assignments, and projects completed throughout the ITAI 2376: Deep Learning course.The course offered hands-on experience in building AI models using TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and cutting-edge tools like Hugging Face, Streamlit, and OpenAI APIs.



Tools & Libraries Used
Python: Core programming language, used in Jupyter Notebooks via Google Colab.
PyTorch: For tensor operations, MLP, RNN, and diffusion models.
TensorFlow/Keras: For CNN implementation (MNIST)
NumPy & JAX: For numerical computing and high-performance ML.
